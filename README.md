# Association-Rule-Mining-Apriori
This project demonstrates how to perform Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm with the help of the mlxtend library in Python. It is especially useful for analyzing market basket data to uncover relationships between items in large datasets.

# 📌 Objectives
Understand the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining.

Preprocess transactional data using TransactionEncoder.

Generate frequent itemsets.

Derive strong association rules using confidence and lift.

# 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure to install the following Python packages:

pip install pandas mlxtend

# ⚙️ Workflow
1. Transaction Encoding
Convert list-based transactions into a one-hot encoded DataFrame using TransactionEncoder.

2. Generating Frequent Itemsets
Use the apriori function to extract itemsets with a minimum support threshold.

3. Extracting Association Rules
Use the association_rules function to derive rules based on metrics like confidence and lift.

4. Filtering Strong Rules
Further refine the rules by applying thresholds for confidence, lift, or other metrics.

# 📈 Output
The notebook displays:

A table of frequent itemsets with their support.

Association rules with their antecedents, consequents, support, confidence, and lift.

# 🔍 Example Rule
If a customer buys bread and milk, they are likely to buy nuts as well.
